# Intelligent-Complaint-Analysis-for-Financial-Services
This project involves building an intelligent chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze real-world customer complaints collected by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The system enables product, support, and compliance teams at CrediTrust Financial to ask natural-language questions.
