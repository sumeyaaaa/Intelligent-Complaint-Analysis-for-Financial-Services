    "3. **Why do users complain about savings accounts?**\n",

    "1. The RAG pipeline:\n",
    "   - Embeds the question using the same embedding model as used during indexing.\n",
    "   - Performs vector similarity search in the FAISS index to retrieve top-matching complaint chunks.\n",
    "   - Combines the question and retrieved context into a prompt.\n",
    "   - Sends the prompt to a language model (LLM) to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The notebook then:\n",
    "   - Displays the question and generated answer.\n",
    "   - Lists the top retrieved text chunks used as context.\n",
    "   - Uses `IPython.display.Markdown()` to present everything in a clean, readable format.\n",
