    "\n",
    "### üìå Objective\n",
    "This notebook evaluates the performance of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system by running test queries and analyzing the quality of generated answers and supporting retrieved chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pipeline Module**: `RAGPipeline` (imported from `rag_pipeline.py`)\n",
    "- **Execution Style**: Interactive question/answer display using IPython Markdown for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùì Test Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following representative questions were chosen to evaluate different financial products:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why are customers unhappy with BNPL?**\n",
    "2. **What issues are reported with credit card disputes?**\n",
    "3. **Why do users complain about savings accounts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions reflect common concerns across key product categories and help assess both retrieval accuracy and generation relevance.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each test question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The RAG pipeline:\n",
    "   - Embeds the question using the same embedding model as used during indexing.\n",
    "   - Performs vector similarity search in the FAISS index to retrieve top-matching complaint chunks.\n",
    "   - Combines the question and retrieved context into a prompt.\n",
    "   - Sends the prompt to a language model (LLM) to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The notebook then:\n",
    "   - Displays the question and generated answer.\n",
    "   - Lists the top retrieved text chunks used as context.\n",
    "   - Uses `IPython.display.Markdown()` to present everything in a clean, readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìã Output Format (per Question)\n",
