    "This notebook is the final tool for evaluating our advanced RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1.  Loads the high-performance `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` model and re-ranker.\n",
    "2.  Loops through a formal list of evaluation questions from a CSV file.\n",
    "3.  For each question, it generates an answer and displays it with its sources.\n",
    "4.  It then prompts for a **manual quality score (1-5)** and **qualitative comments**.\n",
    "5.  Finally, it saves all results, including the manual scores, to a CSV file."
